What is Python? (Simple words)

Python is:

A programming language

Used to tell the computer what to do

Reads almost like English

A dictionary stores data with labels.

Example
train = {
    "number": "12707",
    "class": "sleeper",
    "departure": 22,
    "distance": 750
}


Day 3 – Functions (Reusable Logic)

Goal for today:
Learn how to wrap your logic into functions, reuse it, and avoid repeating code.

What is a Function? (Simple Definition)

A function is:
'''A named block of code that does one job and can be reused.

Instead of writing the same logic again and again, you write it once.'''


Why Functions Are CRITICAL (Real Talk)

Without functions:

'''Code becomes long

Bugs are repeated

Hard to change logic

With functions:

Easy to modify rules

Easy to test

Easy to build APIs later (FastAPI)

Functions are the bridge to real applications.'''


What is Pandas? (Simple Explanation)

'''Pandas is a Python library used to:

Read CSV / Excel files

Work with tables (rows & columns)

Filter, clean, and analyze data

Think of it like Excel in Python.'''


What ML Means (In Simple Words)

Machine Learning means:

The computer learns patterns from past data and uses them to predict future outcomes.
